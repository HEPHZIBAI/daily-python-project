Project Brief
In our last project, we built a script that returned a series of historical events for a given date. The program was command-line-based.

Your task for this project is to make that program more advanced by turning it into a user-friendly web interface.

Expected Output
Here is what the data dashboard web app should look like. You can use Streamlit to build this app.


For your reference, here is the script that returns historical events through the command line. You can make use of the get_historical_events function.
