Project Description
    In this project, we will build and deploy a web app using the Python reflex web framework. 
    My app is already running and can be viewed at this:

    https://clock-lime-ocean.reflex.run

    The web app is a clock showing the current time for different timezones around the world. 
    The user can select the timezone they want:

Learning Benefits
    For this app we use a relatively new, but rapidly emerging web framework -reflex. 
    Reflex is an open-source framework for quickly building beautiful, interactive web applications in pure Python, no Javascript needed. 
    It is more advanced and customizable compared to other similar web frameworks such as Streamlit.

Prerequisites
    Required Libraries:reflex, reflex-chakra, pytz
                        pip install reflex reflex-chakra pytz
