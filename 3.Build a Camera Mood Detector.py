Project Description
    Today, we will build a program that starts the camera on your computer and detects your mood based on your facial expressions.
    For this program, we are using TensorFlow and OpenCV as the two main libraries. 
    As a mood detection model, we are using this here in the link. 
    It detects angry, disgusted, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprised faces.
