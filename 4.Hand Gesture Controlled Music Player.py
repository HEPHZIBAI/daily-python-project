Project Description
    Today, we will build a hand gesture-controlled music player using Python! Instead of pressing buttons, you can play, pause, adjust volume, and switch tracks using only your hand. 
    We’ll use MediaPipe Hand Tracking to detect gestures and Pygame to play music.

How It Works
    • Play/Pause 🛑 ▶️: Show an open palm to play, fist to pause.
    • Volume Control 🔊: Move your thumb and index finger closer or farther apart to adjust volume.
    • Next/Previous Track ⏭️ ⏮️: Swipe left or right with your hand.
    You need some sample MP3 songs for this. You can download these songs here.

Prerequisites

                        pip install opencv-python mediapipe pygame numpy
