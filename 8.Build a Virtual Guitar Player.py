Project Description
    Ever wanted to play an air guitar for real? 
    This project uses hand tracking to detect strumming and play guitar sounds based on your movement. 
    The program is built 100% in Python using the OpenCV and the Mediapipe libraries for image and hand movement detection. 
    The program starts the computer webcam and waits for hand movemeents. Here is a demo of the program:

How It Works
    Move your right hand → Strum the virtual guitar 🎵
    Move your left hand up/down → Change chords 🎼
    Different chords & strumming speed affect the sound! 🎶
    Press ‘q’ to quit ❌
