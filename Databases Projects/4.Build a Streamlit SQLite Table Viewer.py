Project Overview ðŸ’¡
    In this project, you'll create a web app using Streamlit that allows users to upload an SQLite .db file and view its tables interactively. This is a great way to learn about web app development, file handling, and working with databases in Python.

Task:
    Create a Streamlit app that:
    Accepts a .db file upload
    Use this sample .db file.
    Lists all the tables in the database
    Displays the selected table's content in an interactive data viewer

Expected Output: 
    A Streamlit app where users can view the contents of any table from the uploaded SQLite database.
