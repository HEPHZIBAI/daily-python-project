Project Overview üí°
    In this project, you‚Äôll build a basic contact list manager using Python. 
    The app allows users to enter names and phone numbers and saves the list to a text file. 
    This project helps reinforce concepts like loops, lists, string formatting, and file I/O.

Task:
    Write a Python program that:
    Prompts the user to input contact names and phone numbers
    Stores each contact as a name-number pair
    Saves the list to a text file when the user finishes entering contacts

Expected Output: 
    The program prompts the user to enter names and phone numbers through the terminal:
    If the user enters ‚Äúdone‚Äù the program ends and saves the data in a contacts.txt file which looks like the following:

Comparison
    The original version uses a list of formatted strings, which is simple and effective for small projects.
    The alternative version uses a dictionary, which is more flexible if you plan to add features like searching or deleting contacts.
