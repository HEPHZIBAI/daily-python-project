Project Description
    Create a program that reads a list of motivational quotes from a text file and selects one to display every Monday (or any day the user runs the program). 
    It uses Python's date handling to check the current day and ensures youâ€™re greeted with a new quote each time you run it.

Expected Output
    A) Scenario 1: If Monday
        The program checks what day it is. 
        If it is Monday it displays the another text as shown above and picks a quote from the quotes.txt file.
    B) Scenario 2: If not Monday
        If it is not Monday, the program displays some other text as shown below:

Learning Benefits
    File Handling: 
        You will practice reading data from a file, a foundational skill for working with external resources such as databases, logs, or configuration files.
    Randomization: 
        You will practice using the random module to generate unpredictable results, which is common in applications like games, recommendations, and creative tools.
    String Processing: 
        You will practice parsing and manipulating strings, such as slicing, stripping whitespace, and formatting text for better readability.
    Control Flow: 
        You will practice logical structures like if-else to make decisions based on user input, a core aspect of interactive programs.
    Output Formatting: 
        You will practice creating user-friendly console outputs, a valuable skill for making your programs engaging and easy to use.

Prerequisites
    Required Libraries: random, datetime
    Required Files: Download the text file in this link and place it in the same directory as your Python script.
