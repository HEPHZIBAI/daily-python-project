Project Description
Your task for today is to write a Python program that takes a list of numbers and removes all the negative ones. The goal is to keep only numbers that are greater than or equal to zero.

This is a great exercise in list filtering, which is something you’ll often need in real-world projects like:

You’ll start with a predefined list of integers — some positive, some negative, and maybe even zero. Store that list in a variable like so:

numbers = [3, -1, 7, -5, 0, 8, -2]
Your program should create a new list that includes only the non-negative numbers and then print it.

Expected Output
If the list is:

[3, -1, 7, -5, 0, 8, -2]
Then your program should print:
