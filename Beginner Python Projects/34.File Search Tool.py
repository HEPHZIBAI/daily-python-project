Project Objective
    Create a Python script that searches for files in a specified directory based on a search term. 
    The search tool should allow the user to look for files by name or extension and display matching results with their full file paths.

How the Project Works
    (1) The program starts by asking the user to enter a directory path. 
    (2) After the user enters a directory (e.g., /Users/as/Downloads), the program asks the user to enter a search term (e.g., “.png”). 
    (3) Finally, the program lists all the file paths contained in the given directory.

Prerequisites
    Required Libraries: os, glob
