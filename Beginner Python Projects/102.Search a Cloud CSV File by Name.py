Project Description
Your task today is to create a command-line Python app that fetches data from a CSV file hosted online and lets the user query it by name. The program should then display the corresponding age and city of that person.

The CSV file is publicly available at:
https://pythonhow.com/media/django-summernote/2025-06-09/69f2a74b-0950-425d-a1a4-0ce0afe9b755.csv

It contains 3 columns: Name, Age, and City. Here is a screenshot of the data:


Your task is to build a program that:

Downloads the file at runtime

Asks the user to input a name

Looks up the name in the data (case-insensitive)

Prints the age and city if the name is found

Otherwise, prints a friendly "not found" message

This project is a great introduction to working with remote files, CSV data, user input, and data filtering.

Bonus: In the solution page, you will also see how to do this using both the built-in csv module and the powerful pandas library.

Expected Output
When you run the program, it should work like this:



If the name doesn’t exist in the dataset:
