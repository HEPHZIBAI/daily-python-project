Project Description
    Build a program that has a function that takes a list of numbers and calculates their sum, providing the total sum as output to the user.

How the Project Works
    The program starts by defining a function that takes a list of numbers as input.
    The function iterates through the list, adding each number to a running total.
    After iterating through the list, the total sum is returned.
    The user then prints the result using a print() function that calls the sum function and converts the output to a string.
