Project Description
Todayâ€™s project is all about cleaning up data â€” a crucial step in any real-world application. Your task is to build a Python program that removes duplicate values from a list provided by the user.

But here's the twist: instead of using a hardcoded list, your program should prompt the user to input a list of values separated by commas (for example: apple, banana, apple, orange).

Daily Python Projects is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.

The program should then:

Convert the input into a list

Remove any duplicate entries

Print the cleaned list

And show how many duplicates were removed

This kind of functionality is useful in many real-life scenarios â€” think of cleaning up email lists, form submissions, tags in a blog system, or even log entries. Itâ€™s a great exercise in input handling, string manipulation, and basic data processing.

Expected Output
Hereâ€™s what a sample run of your program might look like:
