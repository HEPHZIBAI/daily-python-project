Project Description
Your project for today is to build a basic version of the classic Hangman game in Python.

The program will choose a single secret word (hardcoded for now), and let the user guess one letter at a time. After each guess, it will show the user their progress by revealing correctly guessed letters and keeping underscores (_) for letters they haven’t guessed yet.

The user will have a limited number of incorrect guesses (like 6 tries). If they guess all the letters before running out of tries, they win. Otherwise, they lose and the word is revealed.

This is a perfect beginner project to learn about:

Loops and conditionals

Keeping track of state with lists (letters guessed so far)

String building (showing progress with underscores)

Plus it’s a fun game you can expand later by choosing words randomly from a list or even drawing ASCII hangman graphics.

Expected Output

If they win:


Or if they lose:
