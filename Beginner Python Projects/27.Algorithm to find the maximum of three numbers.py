Project Description
    This program defines three numbers and determines which one is the largest. 
    It then displays the largest number.

How the Project Works
    Start by defining three numbers in your script:

    num1 = 12
    num2 = 45
    num3 = 32
    Create an if-elif-else algorithm that finds out the largest number of the three. Here is the backbone of the script to get you started:

    num1 = 12
    num2 = 45
    num3 = 32

    if num1>...:
        ...
    elif ...
        ...
    else:
        ...

    print(f"The largest number is {}")
    And here is the expected output:
'''
num1 = 12
num2 = 45
num3 = 32

print("the largest number is: ",max(num1,num2,num3))
