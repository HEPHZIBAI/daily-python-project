For this first post, I have found for you the absolute best Python cheatsheet on the internet. If there is one single resource that covers everything you need to know about Python, it is this cheatsheet. I have seen a hundred cheatsheets including one I have created myself, but this one is so dense that you will rarely need to browse Python documentation.

You can view this cheatsheet online here:

The cheatsheet is very up-to-date. It includes new elements of the language such as the Python “match-case” which came out in Python 3.10. The cheatsheet also contains short examples, and it includes advanced Python elements such as OOP.

Of course, you might prefer Google or even ChatGPT to quickly retreive information, but there’s something pleasurable about looking up something on a document, whether it is a PDF or paper.

Have a great weekend!
