The terminal is one of the core tools that real developers use every day, yet programming students donâ€™t learn it and only focus on a programming language instead.

So in this post, Iâ€™m giving away the entire Terminal section from my new course Pre-Coding Bootcamp: Your First Step to Become a Programmer.

ðŸ“¦ What Youâ€™ll Learn in This Free Section
Why the terminal still matters in 2025

How to move around your compute using just commands

How to create, rename, and delete folders or files

How developers use terminals on real production servers

And most importantly â€” youâ€™ll stop being afraid of the black screen

Lecture 1: Welcome to the Terminal â€“ Why Youâ€™ll Love Using It
A short intro to set the tone. Why this tool matters more than you think.


Lecture 2: Why Developers Use the Terminal (and Why You Should Too)
Youâ€™ll see how the terminal gives you speed, precision, and power that you donâ€™t get from point-and-click tools.


Lecture 3: Moving Around Your Computer with Terminal Commands
In this lesson, we start using real terminal commands â€” like cd, ls, pwd, dir â€” across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Youâ€™ll learn how to:

Navigate into folders

Move backward

See where you are in your file system


Lecture 4: Creating Files and Folders Using Terminal Commands
Now we go from reading the file system to changing it.

Youâ€™ll learn:

How to create files (touch, New-Item, etc.)

How to create folders (mkdir)

How to view and manage content from the command line

This is where the terminal starts feeling powerful.


Lecture 5: How Developers Use the Terminal on Real Servers
Finally, Iâ€™ll show you how developers use the terminal to connect to remote servers â€” something youâ€™ll see in real jobs, deployment workflows, and DevOps.
