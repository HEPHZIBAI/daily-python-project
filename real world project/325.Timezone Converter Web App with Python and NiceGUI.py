Project Description
Your task today is to build a Timezone Converter Web App using Python and NiceGUI ‚Äî a modern, responsive, and Pythonic GUI framework for the web.

We live in a global world where people communicate, work, and schedule across different timezones. Whether you're organizing a virtual team meeting or checking a flight time in another country, converting time between zones is essential. This project brings that functionality to life in your own custom web app.

In this app, the user will be able to:

Select a date (e.g., June 3, 2025)

Select a time (e.g., 14:00)

Choose a source timezone (e.g., America/New_York)

Choose a destination timezone (e.g., Asia/Tokyo)

Click a button to convert and display the result

NiceGUI gives you a beautifully styled, fully interactive UI ‚Äî without writing a single line of HTML or JavaScript. Everything runs in Python.

Expected Output
The web app should let the user choose the date, time, original timezone, and target timezone:


Pressing the button will show the converted timezone above the button as shown in the screenshot above.
