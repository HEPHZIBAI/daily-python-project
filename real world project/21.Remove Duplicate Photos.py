Project Brief
    Your task for this project is to create a Python script that looks inside a directory and removes all duplicate pictures of that directory. You can download and use these pictures for the project. Your script should also remove duplicates that have a different resolution/size but are still identical. Therefore, the hashlib library we used in another project will not work here.
