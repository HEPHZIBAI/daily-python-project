Project Brief
    In this project, we will create a task tracker web application using Flask and MaterializeCSS. 
    Users will be able to add tasks to a list, mark them as completed, and delete them. 
    Flask will handle the backend, while MaterializeCSS will be used to style the frontend and provide a responsive design.

Expected Output
    The homepage will display input fields where users can add a task description. Each task will be displayed in a list, with options to mark the task as complete or delete it. The design will be simple but appealing, using MaterializeCSS for a clean and modern UI.

Prerequisites
    Required Libraries: Flask
