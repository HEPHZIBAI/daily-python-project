Project Description
Today’s project is about building a real-world IP Address Locator app using Python and Streamlit, a web framework that makes it easy to create interactive web apps.

Your task is to build an app where users can enter any public IPv4 address (like 8.8.8.8), and the app will fetch and display details like:

Country

Region

City

ZIP code

ISP (Internet provider)

Latitude and Longitude

A map with the location

To do this, you’ll use a free public IP geolocation API such as ip-api.com. You’ll also use the requests library to send HTTP requests and st.map() to display locations visually.

This project is great practice for working with:

Web APIs and JSON data

Streamlit widgets like st.text_input()

Real-time user input

Basic data visualization with a map

It’s a great real-world example of how Python can help you build simple but powerful web tools — like for customer support dashboards, internal admin panels, or security logging utilities.

Expected Output
When the user enters an IP address, the app should show the address details for that IP. The app also shows a map pinpointing the IP location. Here is how our version of the app will look like:
