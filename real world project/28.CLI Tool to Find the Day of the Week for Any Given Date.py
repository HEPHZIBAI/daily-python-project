Ever wondered what day of the week you were born? Or what day of the week will 6.23.2089 be? Letâ€™s make a Python program to calculate the day of the week for any given date in a split second.

Expected Output
This program should be in the form of a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. The user should be able to run the program using the following command from the terminal. For example:

python main.py 6-23-2089

And the program should return this output:

The day of the week for 6-23-2089 is Thursday.

ðŸ‘‰ Note that my program here expects the user date to be in the US date format MM-DD-YYYY.

Here is how the program behaves on my computer:'''
