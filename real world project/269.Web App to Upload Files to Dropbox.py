Project Description
    In yesterday’s project, we built a Python script that uploads files to a Dropbox account through the Dropbox API. 
    In today’s project, we extend that program by creating a web app that any user can use to upload files to our Dropbox account. 
    Such an app can be useful in many scenarios when you want to receive files from a certain group of users.

Expected Output
    The web app lets the user upload a file.
    Once the user uploads a file and presses the “Upload” button, the app will be stored inside the “Apps” folder in your Dropbox account.
    
Prerequisites
    Required Libraries: dropbox, streamlit, doting
                        pip install dropbox python-dotenv streamlit
