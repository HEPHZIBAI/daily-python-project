Project Overview ðŸ’¡
    In this project, youâ€™ll learn how to use Python to merge multiple .txt files from a folder into a single text file. 
    Youâ€™ll use modules like glob and os to locate files and process them programmatically.

Task:
    Write a Python script that:
    Finds all .txt files in a folder
    Put these text files in a folder and use them for this exercise.
    Reads the contents of each file
    Merges them into a single output file, adding newlines between them

Expected Output:
    The program reads all the files in the input folder:
    Then, it creates a new merged_file.txt containing all the content from the .txt files:
