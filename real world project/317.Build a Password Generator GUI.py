Project Description
Your task for today is to build a password generator app with a graphical user interface (GUI) using PyQt5. The app should allow the user to:

Enter the desired password length

Click a button to generate a secure password

View the generated password in the GUI

Save the generated password along with an optional description (e.g., "Gmail account") to a local file

This project will help you practice working with GUIs, random password generation, and basic file handling in Python.

Expected Output
The app window should include:

A text box to enter the desired password length

A “Generate” button

A field showing the generated password

A description input (optional)

A “Save” button that saves the password and description to a file (like passwords.txt)


The file might look like this after saving:
