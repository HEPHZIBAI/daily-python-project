Project Brief
Today we have an easy task to make sure you know how to use Python functions well. Your task is to create five functions:

circle_area: gets the radius and returns the area

circle_circumference: gets the radius and returns the circumference

rectangle_area: gets length and width and returns the area

rectangle_perimeter: gets length and width and returns the perimeter

triangle_area: gets base and height and returns the area

triangle_perimeter: gets the three triangle sides and returns the perimeter

sphere_surface_area: gets the radius and returns the area

sphere_surface_volume: gets the radius and returns the volume

Once you define the functions, call them with some sample values.
