Project Description
    This app uses the Pomodoro technique to help you stay productive by timing work sessions and breaks.
    Each Pomodoro session is 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break. 
    The user can start, pause, and reset sessions. 
    After every four Pomodoros, a longer break of 15 minutes is added.

Prerequisites
    Required Libraries: tkinter, time
