    Build a program to analyze customer review data using pandas and nltk. 
    The program will load review data, perform text cleaning and sentiment analysis, and summarize the data by calculating average ratings for positive, neutral, and negative reviews. 
    This project will demonstrate data processing, natural language processing, and insights extraction using sentiment scores.

Expected Output
    Download the reveiws.csv file from this link and place it in the project directory.
