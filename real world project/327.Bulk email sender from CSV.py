Project Description
In today’s real-world Python project, you’ll build a Bulk Email Sender — a script that reads email addresses and names from a CSV file and sends personalized emails to each person using Python’s built-in csv and smtplib modules.

This is incredibly useful in real life — from sending newsletters and promotional updates, to internal announcements or even school-wide messages. No more copy-pasting emails manually!

Daily Python Projects is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.

Here’s what your app should do:

Load recipient data from a CSV file like recipients.csv, which contains emails and names.

Compose a personalized message for each contact (e.g., "Hi Alice...").

Send the email using your Gmail or Outlook account.

Print a confirmation that each message was sent.

By completing this project, you'll learn:

How to send real emails from Python

How to personalize those messages using CSV data

How to use SMTP with smtplib

And how to safely use app passwords for Gmail and Outlook accounts

Sample recipients.csv File
Create an empty file in your computer, paste the following data, and save the file under the recipients.csv name. Make sure to place some real email addresses there.

email,name
alice@example.com,Alice
bob@example.com,Bob
carol@example.com,Carol
Expected Output
