Project Description
    In this project, you will learn how to detect motion in a video feed and highlight the moving objects. 
    This can be used for applications like surveillance systems or automated video editing. 
    Motion can be detected by Python using the OpenCV library by comparing consecutive frames from a video to detect changes/motion. 
    Then, we highlight the regions in the frame where motion was detected.

How the Project Works
    The program starts the computer webcam and detects motion as shown in the following video:
