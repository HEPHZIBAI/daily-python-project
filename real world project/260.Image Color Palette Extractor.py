Project Brief
    This project extracts the dominant colors from any image and creates a color palette. 
    It uses OpenCV to load the image and scikit-learnâ€™s KMeans clustering to find the main colors. 
    This project will teach you about clustering algorithms and image processing while producing visually engaging results!

Expected Output
    The program reads an image.png file such as the one below:
    After running the program, it should generate and display the color palette for the input image using matplotlib. 
    For the image above, the color palette would be this:

Prerequisites
    Required Libraries: opencv, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
                        pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
