Project Brief
    In this project, you’ll build a Basic Drawing App that allows users to draw freehand lines and shapes on a canvas using the mouse.
    The app will have the ability to change colors and brush sizes. 
    Users will also be able to clear the canvas and save their drawing as an image file.
    This is a great way to practice working with Tkinter’s canvas widget, handling mouse events, and using basic image processing libraries for saving the canvas as an image.

Prerequisites
    Required Libraries: tkinter, pillow
                        pip install pillow
