Project Brief
Yesterday, we coded a Rectangle class that had a width and a height attribute. The class also had an area(), perimeter(), and an is_square() method.

Your task for today is to add two magic methods to that class __str__ and __eq__. The __str__ method should return a string representation of the Rectangle and __eq__ should enable comparing two different rectangle instances returning True or False based on whether the rectangles are similar or not (i.e., have the same width and height).

Expected Output
