Project Brief
    In this project, we will create a bookmark manager web app using Django and Bootstrap, allowing users to add and remove URL bookmarks.

Expected Output
    The above is how the homepage of the web app looks like. 
    The user can add the title and the URL of a website. 
    Pressing the “Add Bookmark” button will add that website to the list of bookmarks. 
    For the frontend, we use Bootstrap to make the website visually appealing.
