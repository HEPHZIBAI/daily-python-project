Your task for today is to build a Timezone Converter Web App using Python and Streamlit.

Every day, millions of people around the world deal with time zone headaches — from scheduling meetings to coordinating flights, remote work, and global events. In this project, you’ll build a real-world tool that helps users convert a specific date and time from one time zone to another.

The app will ask users to:

Select a date

Select a time

Choose a source time zone

Choose a target time zone

After clicking a button, the app should display the converted time using accurate timezone logic (including daylight saving time shifts). This is made easy with the help of Python's datetime module and the third-party pytz library.

By the end of this project, you'll have a polished web app that users can run locally or host online using Streamlit Cloud.

Expected Output
THe user needs to fill in the “Select date” and “Select time” fields to input the original time. Then they need to declare the original timezone and the target timezone.


Pressing the “Convert Time” button should display the converted time under the form:
