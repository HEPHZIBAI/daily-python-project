Project Brief
In yesterday’s project, we generated an HTML showing a map of vehicle accidents at T-intersections across the US in 2022. The problem with that HTML map is that you can’t easily share it with others since it is just an HTML file. That’s where Flask enters the game. Your task for this project is to create a website using Flask. The website should contain the map on the webpage.

Expected Output
The website should contain only one page and that page should contain the interactive map. Here is how the website should look like on the browser:


Step-by-Step Instructions
To get you started easily, below you will find the code that generates the map HTML file. You should build the Flask backend to serve that HTML code on the webpage.
