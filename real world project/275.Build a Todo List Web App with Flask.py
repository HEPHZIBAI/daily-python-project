Project Description
    In todayâ€™s project we will create a todo list web app using the Flask web framework. 
    We have had similar projects before such as the Django todo list app or this command-line task manager app. We will build this one using the Flask web framework. 
    Here is how the web app looks like:

How the app works
    Users can add new tasks, and complete and delete existing tasks.The data are saved in a database.db file. The database file is created by the program the first time the web app runs and then the data are added to the existing database. We use sqlite for handling the database.

The app style
    We have used pure CSS to stylize the frontend HTML elements. However, you can use Bootstrap if you prefer.

Learning Benefits
    Learn how to build a simple full-stack web app.
    Work with the Flask framework for web development.
    Understand how to interact with an SQLite database.
    Get familiar with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Prerequisites
    Required Libraries: sqlite3, flask
                        pip install flask
