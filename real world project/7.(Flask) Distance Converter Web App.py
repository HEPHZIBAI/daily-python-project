Project Brief
Yesterday, we built a distance converter web app using Streamlit. Your task for today is to build a similar app, but this time using Flask which is a more powerful web framework. Here is how the app should look like more or less:


In the above interface, the user can:

Select which type of conversion to make.

Type in a number.

Press the “Convert” button to get the results.

If you want the app to look modern like in the snapshot above, consider using Bootstrap.
