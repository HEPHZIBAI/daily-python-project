Project Overview ðŸ’¡
    In this real-world project, youâ€™ll build a lightweight Streamlit app that allows users to convert distances between kilometers and miles in both directions. 
    This project helps reinforce your knowledge of functions, user input handling, and interactive UI design with Streamlit.

Task:
    Create a Streamlit app that:
    Provides a radio button to select conversion direction
    Accepts a numeric input for distance
    Displays the converted value upon clicking a button

Expected Output:
    The output is an interactive browser-based UI where the user selects a direction, enters a number, clicks a button, and sees the conversion result displayed below.
