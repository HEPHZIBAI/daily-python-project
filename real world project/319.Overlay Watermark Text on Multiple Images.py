Project Description
    Your task for today is to build a real-world Python script that overlays text on multiple images using OpenCV.
    The program should go through all image files in a folder, add a custom text label (like “Sample Text”) to each image, and save the modified images to a new folder.
    You can customize the text, font size, color, and position as needed. 
    This kind of tool is useful for watermarking, labeling datasets, or batch-editing photos.
    Download these sample images to use them for this project:

Expected Output
    When you run the script:
    It should read all images inside a folder called images
    Add the text "Sample Text" to the top-left corner of each image
    Save the edited images in a folder called output
