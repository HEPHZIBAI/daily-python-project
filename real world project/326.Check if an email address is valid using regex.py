Project Description
Your task today is to build a Python program that checks if an email address is valid — using regular expressions (regex). This isn’t just a theoretical exercise: validating email formats is a real-world necessity for login systems, signup forms, newsletter signups, admin dashboards, and more.

Here’s the challenge:

Daily Python Projects is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.

Ask the user to input an email address.

Use a regular expression to validate if it has the correct format (like someone@example.com).

Print whether it’s valid or not.

And for those ready for an extra challenge:
💡 Turn this into a small graphical app using tkinter, so users can paste an email and press a button to validate it.

This project gives you practice with:

re.match() from Python’s re module

Real-world string patterns and data validation

Optional: building a tiny GUI with tkinter
