Project Description
    Today, we will build an app for gamers and tabletop RPG enthusiasts to roll customizable dice (e.g., D6, D20). 
    It’s visually appealing and lets users select dice types and see results with animations!

Expected Output
    The program lets the user to select one of the dice models (e.g., D4):
    The user then presses the “Roll Dice” button to get a number (1 in this case):
    Any time the user rolls the D4 model, they should get a random number from 1 to 4. The same logic goes for the other D-models.

Prerequisites
    Required Libraries: tkinter, random
