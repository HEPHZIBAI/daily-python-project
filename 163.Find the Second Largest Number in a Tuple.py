Project Description
    We will start this week with a small project about tuples. 
    Your task is to write a program that takes a tuple of numbers, finds the second largest number, and prints out that number.
    You can start your program by having this tuple as the first line:

    numbers = (10, 5, 8, 20, 15)
    
    ðŸ‘‰ Note the difference between tuples and lists? 
    Tuples are surrounded by round parenthesis, and they are immutable. 
    Otherwise, they behave very similar.

Expected Output
    Here is what your program should print out:

Learning Benefits
    Tuple Iteration: Practice looping through a tuple efficiently.
    Use of functions: Practice the use of the proper function to find the second large number of a sequence.

'''
numbers = (10, 5, 8, 20, 15)

numbers=list(numbers)
numbers.sort()
print(numbers[-2])
