Project Description
    In this project, you'll learn how to automate the process of uploading files to Dropbox using Python. 
    By building this app, you'll gain hands-on experience with working with cloud storage APIs and automating file uploads. 
    The script will authenticate with Dropbox via an access token, upload a file from your local system, and store it in your Dropbox account.
    ðŸ‘‰ In tomorrowâ€™s project, we will take another step further and turn this app into a full web app where users can upload files through a web interface.

Prerequisites
    Required Libraries: dropbox
                        pip install dropbox
    Required Files: Download our file.txt sample file to upload it to Dropbbox.
