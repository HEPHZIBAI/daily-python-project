Your task for today is to build a GUI-based timebox tracker that helps users work in focused sessions using the Pomodoro method (or any custom session length they choose). You‚Äôll practice GUI programming, timers, state management, and simple session summaries.

üìù Project Task
The program should:

Provide a graphical interface with controls to Start, Pause/Resume, Reset, and Skip.

Let the user choose a timebox length (e.g., 25 minutes Pomodoro) and break length (e.g., 5 minutes).

Show a countdown timer and the current mode (Focus / Break).

Support auto-switching between Focus and Break when a session ends (with a beep/notification if possible).

Track completed focus sessions in the current run and display a small summary (e.g., ‚Äú3 sessions completed‚Äù).

Bonus (optional):

Allow a long break after N focus sessions (e.g., 15 minutes after 4 Pomodoros).

Add a task name field to tag sessions.

Persist session history to a CSV file (date, task name, focus minutes completed).

This is a practical project for building better work habits while learning real GUI patterns and timer logic.

üìå Expected Output
When you launch the app, it should display:

Inputs for Focus length and Break length (minutes).

Buttons for Start, Pause/Resume, Reset, Skip.

A large countdown (e.g., 24:59) and a label like Mode: Focus.

A small summary line such as Completed sessions: 3.

Here is how the app will look like:


If you include CSV logging, each finished focus session should append a row such as:

2025-08-11,Task: Write draft,Focus Minutes: 25
