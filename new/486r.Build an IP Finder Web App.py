Project Description
    Yesterday’s project was about converting an IP address to an address. 
    Today’s project is to build a web app that displays the user’s public IP address using Python and Streamlit.
    Every time you browse the web, your internet provider assigns your device a public IP address. 
    This project will fetch that IP using a simple API and display it in a clean web interface. 
    It’s a great example of how Python can interact with online services to build real-time tools.

You’ll create a button that, when clicked, sends a request to an IP detection service like
    https://api.ipify.org
retrieves the IP address in JSON format, and displays it on the page.

This is useful in real-life for:
    Verifying VPNs or proxy setups
    Building login dashboards that show “Last seen from IP”
    Teaching API basics in web apps
    The app will be simple, fast, and very practical.

Expected Output
    When the app runs and the user clicks the “Get My IP” button, it should show something like:
