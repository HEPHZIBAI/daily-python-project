Project Overview ðŸ’¡
    In this project, you'll create a Streamlit app that reads numerical data from text files in a folder and visualizes it using a line chart. 
    This combines file handling, data processing with pandas, and interactive plotting with Streamlit.

Task:
    Write a Streamlit app that:
    Reads numbers from all .txt files in a folder
    Please download and use the text files in the link below:
    Extracts the filename (without extension) and number from each file
    Plots the numbers using Streamlit's line chart
    Displays the file name and number as a reference list

Expected Output: 
    An interactive line chart showing values from the text files and a list of corresponding filenames with their values.
