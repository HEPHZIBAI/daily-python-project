Project Overview ðŸ’¡
    In this project, you'll learn how to use regular expressions and file handling in Python to extract the first sentence from every .txt file in a directory. This is especially useful for summarizing or previewing content across multiple documents.

Task:
    Write a Python program that:
    Loops through all .txt files in a folder
    (You can use these text files and place them in a folder)
    Reads the content of each file
    Extracts and prints the first sentence using regular expressions

Expected Output: 
    The program should print the first sentence found in each text file to the terminal. Below we have highlighted each sentence printed out in the terminal:
