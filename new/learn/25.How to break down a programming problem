Hi everyone!

I have exciting news—I’m just two weeks away from publishing my newest course on Udemy! Today, I’ve hand-picked a video from that course that I believe will help you improve your ability to code a program from start to finish.

One of the biggest challenges learners face is not knowing how to break down a programming problem, which often leads to getting stuck. This is a crucial skill that most programming courses don’t teach. In my newest course, I’ll cover programming concepts, techniques, and tools that traditional programming language courses overlook—but are essential for becoming a programmer.

Today’s video walks you through the thought process you need to follow to code a program from start to finish, using a real example to illustrate the steps.
