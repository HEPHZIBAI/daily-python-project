Hi everyone!

We are thrilled to share some fantastic news that will elevate your Python learning journey. Starting this Friday (today), we are launching a new feature on the blog – the Friday Video Series!

Daily Python Projects is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.

That will replace the Friday project with a brand new video every week made exclusively for the subscribers of Daily Python Projects. Our goal is to make this hub an all-in-one unique platform for learning Python efficiently and in a fun way.

New Video Every Friday
I will be posting a comprehensive video every Friday covering complex and essential programming concepts. These videos are designed to help you grasp difficult topics and enhance your coding skills.

The video on the last Friday of every month will be absolutely free! This is my way of saying thank you for being such a dedicated learner and supporter of the blog.

Today's Free Video: Since today is the last Friday of this month, you’re in for a treat! You’ve just received exclusive access to our very first video titled "Comparison of Python Programming Paradigms". Please check your inbox!

Why Videos?
Videos offer a dynamic way to learn, allowing you to see concepts in action and understand them more intuitively. That will complement the daily projects. With detailed explanations and practical examples, these videos will help you master advanced topics more effectively.

We have more improvements in the pipeline to make Daily Python Projects an even richer learning environment for you.

Stay tuned!
