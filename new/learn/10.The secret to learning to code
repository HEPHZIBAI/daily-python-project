Half of the people who start learning to code eventually give up. I learned this after teaching Python to 500,000 students on Udemy. That's why we created Daily Python Projects ‚Äîto break that vicious cycle. See below how.

First, the ugly truth
The internet is full of Python courses including mine. Over 500,000 students have studied in my Python courses and I am proud to have received countless messages of success stories from students. However, they didn‚Äôt learn Python through my course. They learned Python by building programs on their own. A course shows you the way. You have to walk the path yourself. So, stop thinking a course alone will teach you Python.

Learning to code is like building muscle
An online course is like a muscle-building manual that shows you a wealth of information. However, a manual will show you the way. It will not build the muscle for you. You can‚Äôt build muscle just by reading a book. You have to do the work yourself. You have to go through discomfort. Similarly, if you want to learn to code, you have to challenge yourself. And that challenge has the form of building projects on your own. That brings us to the next point.

Building projects on your own
Something magical happens in the brain when you are faced with a problem that you have to solve on your own. You focus on one thing and one thing only. And that is the problem you have at hand. And everything you do to solve that problem gets memorized in your brain because the mind opens up to sucking up information, so the next time you are faced with a similar problem, it becomes easier to solve that problem. And that is a golden window of opportunity to learn new things. That is where real learning starts to happen. And that is why we created Daily Python Projects. This platform is designed exclusively for you to learn Python.

The steps to learning Python
So, the secret to learning Python is working with projects. If you don‚Äôt know anything about Python, here are the steps to your learning path:

Learn Python Basics
Go through a Python course that covers Python from scratch so you can learn Python basics first. Python Mega Course on Udemy is a one-stop-shop that covers Python from scratch and has been reviewed by over 60,000 students. It covers real-world applications so you understand exactly how Python is used in the real world.

Work on projects with Daily Python Projects
Once you learn Python basics, start as soon as possible with solving your first project. Look at our ever-growing project archive and pick a project that you find interesting. It is very important to choose a topic you are passionate about because it will accelerate your learning. You can choose projects about building desktop GUIs, web apps, data analysis, etc. We have everything. Also, start with the easy üå∂Ô∏è projects first and then progress to harder üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è ones. Don‚Äôt forget to subscribe to get a fresh, new Python project in your inbox every day.

Consider the paid plan of Daily Python Projects

The free plan will give you one project every day in your inbox. However, the project source code and bonus explanations on solutions are not included. By subscribing to the paid plan, you will get our solution for every project so you can compare your solution with ours. When necessary, solutions also cover explanations on the techniques used to solve the project to give you further insights into how programming logic works and understand how one solution is better than the other.


Daily Python Projects was specifically designed to take you out of the infamous ‚ÄúTutorial Hell‚Äù which is a state of constant learning of one tutorial after another without putting acquired knowledge into practice. Let‚Äôs do it!
