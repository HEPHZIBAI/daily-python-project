Let’s be real.
When you’re just trying to figure out how to make your code work, the last thing on your mind is how it looks.

But here’s the truth:

Daily Python Projects is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.

Clean code isn’t about being “fancy.” It’s about being readable—by you and every other human (or future you) who touches it.

That’s where PEP 8 comes in.

1. So, what is PEP 8?
PEP 8 is a set of guidelines for how Python code should be written—things like:

Where to put spaces

How to name variables

When to break a long line of code

How to write functions and import modules

Think of it as Python’s style guide—like grammar rules for code.

It’s not about what your code does.
It’s about making sure your code is clean, consistent, and easy to read.

2. “But why should I care about PEP 8 if I’m just learning?”
Because:

You’ll read your own code later and not wonder “what the heck is this?”

You’ll work on teams someday (even if it’s just future-you and past-you).

Clean code = fewer bugs. If your code is easy to read, it’s easier to fix.

Also: interviewers care. Reviewers care. Clients care.
Why? Because clean code is a sign that you’re a thoughtful developer, not just someone who throws things together.

3. The Most Important PEP 8 Rules to Know
Let’s keep it practical. If you follow just these, you’re already ahead:

✅ Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
def greet():
    print("Hello")
❌ Don't write code like this:
def greet():print("Hi")
✅ Put spaces around operators
x = 10 + 3
Not:

x=10+3
✅ Leave 2 blank lines before defining a new function (outside a class)
def add():
    return 1 + 1


def subtract():
    return 2 - 1
✅ Name variables clearly, using lowercase with underscores
user_age = 32
Not:

ua = 32  # unreadable
✅ Keep lines under 79 characters
Why? Because when you’re reading code side-by-side (like in a Git diff), long lines are a pain.

4. How to Actually Follow PEP 8 (Without Memorizing It)
You don’t need to remember all this.
Just use tools that catch your mistakes for you:

flake8 – highlights PEP 8 violations in your code

black – automatically formats your code to follow the rules

pylint – checks style and code quality

I personally use black on every project. One command. Instant cleanup.

black my_script.py
5. TL;DR
PEP 8 = Python’s official style guide for writing clean, readable code

It’s not about being strict. It’s about making your code easier to understand

Use tools like black to fix things automatically

Start small. Even fixing your spaces and variable names makes a difference

Coding is hard enough—don’t let messy formatting make it harder.

Clean code makes everything better.
