What is data science?
At its core, data science = 3 things:

Collecting data – from files, websites, APIs, databases.

Understanding the data – filtering it, cleaning it, analyzing it.

Using it to answer real questions – through charts, numbers, or predictions.

In other words, you use data science to answer questions such as:

Daily Python Projects is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.

“Hmm, I wonder what people buy most on Fridays?”
“How many subscribers do I gain each month?”
“Which city has the worst air pollution trends over the past 10 years?”

And Python is the tool to go find the answer.

So how does Python fit into all this?
Here’s where Python shines: it has libraries—tools—that make all the boring, repetitive stuff super fast.

Let me give you a real-world example:

Example: You're analyzing a CSV of customer orders
Step 1: Collect the data
import pandas as pd 

data = pd.read_csv("orders.csv")
Step 2: Understand the data
data.head()  # Preview first 5 rows  
data["country"].value_counts()  # See where most orders come from
Step 3: Answer the question
# What’s the average order size?
print(data["order_value"].mean())
You just did data science. It is the “science” of the data.

Python Tools Used in Data Science
Here’s what Python brings to the table:

pandas – for data analysis and wrangling

matplotlib / seaborn – for plotting and visualizing data

numpy – for number crunching

scikit-learn – for making predictions

jupyter – for running experiments and sharing results

requests / BeautifulSoup – for collecting data from websites

Each one is a tool. You don’t need to learn them all at once.
You just pick the right one for the job—when you need it.

So should you learn data science?
Only if:

You like making sense of messy stuff

You enjoy spotting patterns

You want to work in fields like finance, marketing, sports, healthcare, or AI

You enjoy asking “why?” and trying to prove it with numbers

If yes—start small.
And start with Python.
(You’re already in the right place.)

TL;DR
Data science = using data to answer real questions.

Python = the easiest way to do it.

You don’t need to “master” Python first.

Just start with a question and use code to chase the answer.

Want a project that gets your hands dirty with real data? I will sen one tomorrow and another on Friday.
