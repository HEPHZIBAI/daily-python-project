Project Overview üí°
    In this project, you‚Äôll write a Python script that appends the current date to all .txt filenames in a specified folder. 
    This is useful for version control, organizing files by date, or backing up daily logs.

Task:
    Write a Python program that:
    Goes through each .txt file in a directory
    Appends the current date to the filename
    For example, file a.txt should be renamed to a-2025-5-8.txt (existing_name-YYYY-MM-DD.txt)
    You can download and use these sample files and place them in a directory named ‚Äúfiles‚Äù.

Expected Output:
    The console will display the old and new names of each file.
    And here is how the renamed files look like:
