Project Brief
    Your task for this project is to build a web app where users can download YouTube videos. 
    Here is what the app should look like:
    A user can provide a YouTube video URL and press the “Download Video” button. 
    The video should be downloaded and saved in the project directory.
    We are using the Streamlit web framework for this. Please note that this project is for educational purposes and you shouldn’t use this app to download YouTube videos for other reasons as that may be against the YouTube policy.
