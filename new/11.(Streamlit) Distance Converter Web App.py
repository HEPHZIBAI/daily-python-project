Project Description
In a previous project last week, we built a desktop GUI app for converting kilometers to miles. Today, your task is to create a web app that converts kilometers to miles and vice-versa. Here is how the app should look more or less:


In the above interface, the user can:

Select which type of conversion to make.

Type in a number.

Press the “Convert” button to get the results.

You can use any Python web framework to build the web app, but the code given in the solution section uses the Streamlit framework which is the easiest Python web framework to use for building small web apps. In the resources section further below, you will find a link to a Streamlit tutorial.
