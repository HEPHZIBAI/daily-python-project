You can also simply use it as a PDF or upload it to your phone, but I highly recommend printing it. Having something on paper will help you retain Python syntax. Keep it handy whenever you're coding or learning Python.

The cheatsheet is part of my course Python Mega Course: Learn Python in 60 Days, Build 20 Apps.

Have a great rest of the week!
