Project Description
    Your task for today is to build a password generator app with a graphical user interface (GUI) using PyQt5. 

The app should allow the user to:
    Enter the desired password length
    Click a button to generate a secure password
    View the generated password in the GUI
    Save the generated password along with an optional description (e.g., "Gmail account") to a local file
    This project will help you practice working with GUIs, random password generation, and basic file handling in Python.

Expected Output
    The app window should include:
    A text box to enter the desired password length
    A “Generate” button
    A field showing the generated password
    A description input (optional)
    A “Save” button that saves the password and description to a file (like passwords.txt)
    The file might look like this after saving:
