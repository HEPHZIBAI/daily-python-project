In yesterdayâ€™s project, we build a travel assistant where the user chatted through a command line interface. Today we take that app a step further and implement a web interface so you can easily publish the app to make it usable by everyone ðŸŽ‰.

Project Description
Your project today is to build a real-world travel assistant web app using Python, Googleâ€™s Gemini model, and the Gradio library to build the web interface.
As in the original project, this isnâ€™t just any travel chatbot â€” youâ€™ll train it with a special prompt so it avoids clichÃ© destinations and instead recommends hidden gems and out-of-the-beaten-path places.

This is exactly how modern travel startups or bespoke concierge services build specialized AI tools:

They use powerful language models, but shape their personality and expertise with carefully crafted system prompts.

They secure API keys in environment files (like .env) so nothing sensitive leaks into the code.

And they provide a clean, friendly user interface through tools like Gradio, Streamlit, Flask, Django, etc.

When youâ€™re done, youâ€™ll have a working AI travel advisor running right in your browser. Ask it where to travel in Europe that isnâ€™t Rome or Paris, or in Asia without crowds â€” and see what creative ideas it gives you.

Expected Output
When you run your app and open it in your browser, a typical conversation between the user and the AI might look like this:


As you can see, the AI tries to give advice about travel destinations that are not mainstream and all that happens in a beautiful web interface.
