Project Task
Your task for today is to build a calculator chatbot using LangChain and Gemini. This project combines the power of LLMs with custom system prompts to simulate tools â€” in this case, a simple command-line calculator.

The program should:

Load your Gemini API key from an .env file using dotenv.

Create a Gemini-based chatbot using the ChatGoogleGenerativeAI class from LangChain.

Use a system prompt that instructs the model to act as a calculator.

Accept user input (e.g., 45 + 12) repeatedly.

Let the Gemini model respond with the answer.

Keep track of conversation history to maintain context.

Exit the loop when the user types "exit".

This project introduces you to LangChainâ€™s Gemini integration, environment variables, and basic conversational AI applications with a practical utility flavor.

ðŸ“Œ Expected Output
When you run the program, it should prompt the user to type a math expression. Each expression is passed to the Gemini API, and the response is printed as a "Calculator" reply.

Example interaction:



The assistant will behave like a calculator, returning results based on the prompt youâ€™ve given.
