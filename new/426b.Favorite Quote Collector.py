Project Description
    Your task for todayâ€™s project is to create a Python program that allows users to add their favorite quotes to a text file and 
    then display all saved quotes.

How the Program Works
    The program starts by asking the user to enter a quote:
    For example, the user types in a quote from Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the program saves it in a quotes.txt file, and 
    prints out all the saved quotes.

How This Project Matters in the Real-World
    Storing and retrieving text-based information is a core function in many applications. 
    This simple program mirrors how user-generated content, such as notes, journal entries, or testimonials, is saved and 
    displayed in real-world apps like note-taking tools, blogging platforms, or personal databases.
