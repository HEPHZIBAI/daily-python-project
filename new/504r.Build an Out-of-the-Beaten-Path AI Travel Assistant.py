Project Description
    Today you’ll build a real-world Python app that acts as a travel assistant chatbot, but with a unique twist:
    instead of giving you mainstream tourist recommendations, it will suggest out-of-the-beaten-path destinations — hidden gems only savvy travelers know about.
    This kind of niche specialization is exactly how many travel startups or bespoke concierge services use AI in practice. 
    By customizing the system prompt, you’ll make sure the chatbot consistently focuses on recommending places that are less crowded, more authentic, and often overlooked by typical guides.

Your app will:
    Load your Gemini API key securely from a .env file using python-dotenv.
    Connect to Google’s gemini-1.5-flash-latest model.
    Use a system-style prompt to shape the AI’s personality and expertise. In our case tell it to suggest travel destinations out of the beaten path instead of the mainstream destinations.
    Run an interactive terminal chat, where you can keep asking travel questions until you type exit.

Expected Output
    The user can chat with the AI assistant by simply describing what kind of holiday they want and where they are located. The AI will give travel ideas that are not mainstream. Here is an sample conversation:
