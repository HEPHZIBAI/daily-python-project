Letâ€™s start the week by using Python to create a map of all car accidents that occurred at T-intersections across the US in 2022. You are recommended to use the Folium library for this. With Folium you can build interactive web-based maps.

Expected Output
Your program should generate an HTML file. The HTML file should show the following interactive map when opened in a browser:


As you can see, we have used clustering here due to having too many points to display all at once. Each blue marker represents the location of an accident. When the user clicks a marker, information about the accident pops up. This information is taken from the MAN_COLLNAME column in the data.
