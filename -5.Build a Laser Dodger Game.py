Project Description
    Today we will build a laser dodger game with Python using the PyQt6 GUI library:
    This is a great app to learn how to use PyQt -one of best Python libraries for building graphical user interfaces. 
    It is also a way to test your reflexes by playing the game. 
    Dodge falling lasers, stay alive as long as possible, and prove you have the quickest reactions in the galaxy!

How to Play
    Control your player (a glowing green orb) using the left and right arrow keys.
    Lasers will fall from the sky at random positions— don’t get hit! Survive as long as possible!
    You will find the complete code behind the “Show Code” button.
